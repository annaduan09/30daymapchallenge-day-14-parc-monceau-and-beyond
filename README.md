## Data Sources

The data for this project was sourced from Open Data Paris, which provided detailed information on parks, arrondissement boundaries, the River Seine, and street layouts. The raw data can be accessed through their official platform: [Open Data Paris](https://lnkd.in/eTNVcDz3).

## Tools Used

The map was created using the R programming language, leveraging the `tidyverse` and `ggplot2` packages for data manipulation and visualization. The design process involved creative solutions to label the parks effectively, considering the radial layout of Paris's urban plan.

## Map Features

- **Green Spaces:** All the parks and green spaces within the city are marked and labeled.
- **River Seine:** The iconic river is highlighted, providing a geographical context.
- **Arrondissement Boundaries:** The administrative divisions of Paris are outlined.
- **Streets:** Major streets are included to give a sense of the urban grid.

## Reflection

The challenge for this map was not only in the visualization but also in capturing the essence of Paris's urban greenery. The radial plan of Paris posed a unique challenge for labeling, requiring innovative approaches to fit the names of parks within the intricate curves and angles of the city's layout.
